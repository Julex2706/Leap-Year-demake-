# PuzzleScript Next Project

This is a puzzle game built with **PuzzleScript Next**.

### Play & Test
Since the game is still in development and lacks official levels, you can test the mechanics directly in the editor:

### Status
The project is currently in **active development**. I am still fine-tuning the gameplay and will update the repository frequently.

### Features
I have implemented the following mechanics:
*   **Fall Physics**
*   **Flags & Spikes**
*   **One-way Tiles**
*   **Characters**

### Feedback & Contribution
Please feel free to test all features and provide **feedback**. Any help or suggestions are highly appreciated! 

I have made an effort to keep the code **clean and easy to understand** for anyone who wants to take a look.
